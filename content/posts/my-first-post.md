# Welcome to Currents and Contemplations

Hello - my name is Carter. I'm a fly-fishing enthusiast based in Denver, Colorado. This blog serves as a location for my thoughts and experiences both on and off the water. Ideally, a few people other than myself and my mother visit the website, but truth be told this is a place for me to combat my terrible memory. And maybe, it's an invitation to practice presence in the moment, at least enough to regurgitate some  words out that summarize this beautiful thing called life.
