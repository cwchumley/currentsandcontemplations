![Carter Chumley](/images/home-page/head-shot.JPG)

My name's Carter - I live in Denver, Colorado and grew up in Richmond, Virginia. I moved to Denver in 2018, and shortly after my brother, Harlan, introduced me to fly fishing. A trip, fall and full blown infatuation later, I've gotten the chance to experience some amazing things through fly fishing. Outside of fishing, I enjoy a handful of things that many other 30-something males in Colorado enjoy - both playing and seeing live music, cooking & eating good food, traveling, gardening and spending time with my wife, Jamie and dog, Blue.
