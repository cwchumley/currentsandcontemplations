# About Currents and Contemplations

Welcome to my personal blog where I get to have a one sided conversation with the internet. Life is too great of a thing to not record and reflect upon. I hope to do a little justice to the memories made both on and off the water, in times of solitude and reflection, and friendship and revelry. You can expect musings about fishing as well as music, travel and some other miscellaneous topics as I feel inspired enough to write about them.

## About Me

My name's Carter - I'm live in Denver, Colorado and hail from Richmond, Virginia originally. I moved to Denver in 2018, and shortly after my brother, Harlan,  introduced me to fly fishing. A trip, fall and full blown infatuation later, I've gotten the chance to experience some amazing things through fly fishing. I enjoy a handful of things that many other 30-something white males in Colorado enjoy - both playing and seeing live music, cooking and eating good food, traveling, gardening and spending time with my wife, Jamie and dog, Blue.
